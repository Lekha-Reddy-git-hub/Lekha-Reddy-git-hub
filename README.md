👋 Hi, I'm Srilekha. I build things that didn't exist until I needed them.

I get excited about problems that sit at the intersection of messy operations and clean software. The kind of problems where someone says "we just do that manually" and I think "...but why?"

Here's what I've been building:

- **m402**: A machine-native payment protocol built on Tempo for machine-native payments on physical-world data networks. Live demo: m402.vercel.app

- **anova**: An AI-powered FP&A variance analyzer. Because nobody should spend 4 hours in Excel figuring out why Q3 revenue is off by 12%. You upload your actuals vs. budget, it tells you what moved and why.
