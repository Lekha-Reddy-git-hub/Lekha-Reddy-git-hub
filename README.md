👋 Hi, I'm Srilekha. I build things that didn't exist until I needed them.

I get unreasonably excited about problems that sit at the intersection of messy operations and clean software. The kind of problems where someone says "we just do that manually" and I think "...but why?"

Here's what I've been building:

- **anova**: An AI-powered FP&A variance analyzer. Because nobody should spend 4 hours in Excel figuring out why Q3 revenue is off by 12%. You upload your actuals vs. budget, it tells you what moved and why.

- **m402**: A machine-native payment protocol on Tempo. HTTP 402 "Payment Required" has been a placeholder since 1992. This is what happens when you actually build it for machines talking to machines.

- **Spatial computing for CAD**: Research prototypes using Halo smart glasses to manipulate 3D designs with gesture and gaze. In progress.
